Analysis of renewable energy company's stocks in 2017 and 2018

## Overview
-The goal of this stock analysis were to calculate the total volume traded and the return on 12 different stocks.This analysis better helps the clients decide which stock is the best, given the data and desired metrics.

## Results
-I found that, for 2017, SPWR had the highest trade volume and all stocks were in the green except for TERP and DQ had the highest return at 202%. For 2018, ENPH had the highest trade volume. ENPH and RUN were the only two stocks in the green that year, where ENPH had a return of 97.9%.
-There was a significant difference between the rendering times fromt the original and refactored scripts. The 2018 original program ran in about 0.6 seconds and the refactored 2018 ran in 0.008 seconds. Both of the programs ran seemingly instantaneous but this would make more of a difference with a larger dataset. Screenshots of the run times can be found in the Resources folder in this GitHub file.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
-There are clear advantages to refactoring code. When writing programs the first time over, I write the code that makes sense and works. Refactoring allows me to clean up the code so that it is more readable and has better logic. The only con to refactoring is taking the extra time to go back and rewrite the code. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
-While going over it again, I was able to fully comprehend the logic, and mnimize the amount of code required to execute the program. I got the same results in much less time. The code turned out easier to read and comprehend.
